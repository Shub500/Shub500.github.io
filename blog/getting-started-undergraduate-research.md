title: "Getting Started with Undergraduate Research in Computer Science"

Research as an undergraduate can seem daunting, but it's one of the most rewarding experiences you can have. Here's a practical guide from my experience to getting started.

## Finding Research Opportunities

### 1. Start with Your Own Institution

#### Quick Hits
- Browse faculty websites in your department
- Look for professors whose work aligns with your interests
- Check out recent publications and ongoing projects
- Attend department seminars and research talks

**Reality Check**: Research opportunities can range from formal to informal and vary significantly in competitiveness. Depending on the size of your institution and the corresponding number of faculty in your CS department, just applying to labs may end up being quite competitive.

#### Understanding Lab Structures

**Large, Established Labs**
- Multiple PhD students, postdocs, and undergraduates
- Well-defined projects with clear structure
- Formal application processes (sometimes with interviews)
- More mentorship layers but potentially less direct faculty interaction
- Great for learning established methodologies

**Smaller Labs or Direct Faculty Mentorship**
- Working directly under a professor's guidance
- More informal application process
- Higher chance of leading your own projects
- Greater independence and responsibility
- Stronger faculty relationships

#### Choosing Your Path

**If you want structured support and teamwork**: Large labs offer established support systems, mentorship hierarchies, and collaborative environments. Don't be discouraged by competitive application processesâ€”they're often worth the effort.

**If you want independence and leadership**: I strongly recommend seeking opportunities where you can take initiative and propose your own projects. This approach makes it much easier to get your foot in the door, builds stronger relationships with faculty, and lets you pursue topics you're genuinely passionate about. You'll learn faster by going into the deep end.

### 2. Reach Out Strategically
- Read 2-3 recent papers from professors you're interested in working with
- Send personalized emails mentioning specific aspects of their work and connect it back to your prior expereince whether that be in coursework or projects
- Be specific about your availability and commitment level
- **For independent projects**: Come prepared with 1-2 concrete project ideas that build on their work

### 3. Look Beyond Your School
- Summer research programs (REUs in the US and/or National Labs)
- Remote research opportunities
- Industry research internships
- Open source projects with research components

## Preparing Yourself

### Technical Skills
- Strong programming fundamentals
- Familiarity with relevant tools and frameworks
- Basic understanding of machine learning/statistics
- Version control (Git) proficiency

### Research Skills
- Learn to read academic papers effectively
- Practice presenting technical concepts clearly
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities
- Get comfortable with uncertainty and iteration

## Making the Most of Research

### Set Clear Expectations
- Discuss goals and timelines with your mentor
- Understand the project's scope and your role
- Ask about potential publication opportunities
- Clarify time commitments and meeting schedules

### Stay Organized
- Keep detailed notes and documentation
- Maintain a research journal
- Track your progress and challenges
- Document your code and experiments thoroughly

### Be Proactive
- Ask questions when you're stuck
- Suggest new ideas and approaches
- Take initiative on related tasks
- Seek feedback regularly

## Common Challenges and Solutions

**Imposter Syndrome**: Remember that everyone starts somewhere. Your fresh perspective is valuable.

**Technical Hurdles**: Don't hesitate to ask for help. Most researchers are happy to explain concepts.

**Slow Progress**: Research involves lots of failed experiments. This is normal and part of the process.

**Time Management**: Balance research with coursework by setting realistic goals and expectations.

**Competitive Applications**: If you face rejections from established labs, consider reaching out to newer faculty or proposing independent projects. Sometimes the best opportunities come from less obvious sources.

## Next Steps

Once you've gained some research experience:
- Consider presenting at undergraduate research conferences
- Apply for competitive summer programs
- Think about graduate school or research-focused industry roles
- Build relationships with multiple faculty members
