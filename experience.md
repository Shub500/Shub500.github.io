### Research Experience

**Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** - *Summer Computing Scholar* (2025)
- Developed VeriMed-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for biomedical claim validation using decision-theoretic veritable checks
- Implemented self-reflection mechanisms and fine-tuned LLM modules for statistical check failures using synthetic examples based on Synthea-generated data
- Built evaluation datasets across multiple knowledge base configurations (TY0-TY10) to test RAG performance under varying document states

**Prism Lab, Cornell University** - *Research Assistant* (2024 – Present)
- Created VeriMinder, an interactive system for detecting analytical vulnerabilities in NL2SQL workflows, achieving 82.5% positive user ratings for analysis quality improvement
- Developed contextual semantic mapping framework for bias detection and operationalized the Hard-to-Vary principle for systematic data analysis
- Architected SIFOTL's twin XGBoost models with Pareto-weighted decision trees for privacy-preserving tabular learning, achieving F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 on synthetic EHR datasets

**Social Dynamics Lab, Cornell University** - *Research Assistant* (2024 – Present)
- Co-developed multi-LLM framework for automated persuasive dialogue generation with structured prompt engineering pipelines
- Fine-tuned BERT and LLAMA-3.2-8B models for persuasion strategy classification using critic feedback and self-reflection mechanisms
