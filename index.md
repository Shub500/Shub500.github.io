Hello, I'm Shubham, an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Computer Science with a focus on machine learning, data systems, and AI safety. I am interested in developing robust, interpretable AI systems that can operate reliably in real-world environments. My research spans areas including tabular learning, natural language interfaces to databases, and privacy-preserving machine learning.
