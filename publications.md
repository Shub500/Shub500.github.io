## Conference Papers

**VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2025*  
<!-- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/placeholder) | [Code](https://github.com/veriminder/veriminder) | [Website](https://veriminder.ai) -->

> Introduces an interactive system for detecting and mitigating cognitive biases in natural language database queries through contextual semantic mapping and Hard-to-Vary principle operationalization. Achieved 82.5% user effectiveness rating with 30% improvement over baseline approaches.

**SIFOTL: A Principled, Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular Learning**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2025*  
<!-- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/placeholder) | [Code](https://github.com/sifotl/sifotl) -->

> Presents a privacy-preserving framework for identifying data shift factors in tabular datasets using twin XGBoost models and LLM-guided feature synthesis. Achieved F1 scores of 0.85-0.96 on healthcare datasets, outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis by 85%.

<!-- ## Under Review

**SAVL-II: Surrogate-Aided Vertical Learning for Agent-to-Agent Systems with Inference-Time Independence**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*Under Review*  
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/placeholder)

> Develops a vertical federated learning framework enabling inference-time independence in agent-to-agent systems through surrogate feature generation. Achieves 81% AUPRC of oracle performance while maintaining complete operational autonomy.

## Technical Reports

**VeriMed-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Biomedical Proposition Validation**  
**Shubham Mohole**, et al.  
*Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Technical Report, 2025*

> Implements hierarchical validation framework for biomedical claims using 11 "Veritable Checks" with transparent audit trails. Created validation dataset with 5,000+ biomedical propositions. -->
