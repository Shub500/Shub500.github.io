## Conference Papers

**VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2025*  
[Paper]({{ '/assets/VeriMinder_Paper.pdf' | relative_url }}) | [Website](https://veriminder.ai)

*VeriMinder addresses cognitive biases in natural language database queries through a three-stage framework: contextual semantic mapping, Hard-to-Vary principle operationalization, and optimized LLM-powered refinement. User evaluation shows 82.5% positive impact on analysis quality with significant improvements in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.*

**SIFOTL: A Principled, Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular Learning**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2025*  
[Paper](https://kdd2025.kdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CameraReady-03.pdf)

*SIFOTL identifies factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets using privacy-compliant statistical summaries, twin XGBoost models, and Pareto-weighted decision trees. Achieves F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 on synthetic EHR datasets while maintaining privacy compliance.*

**Communication Makes Perfect: Persuasion Dataset Construction via Multi-LLM Communication**

Weicheng Ma, Hefan Zhang, Ivory Yang, Shiyu Ji, Joice Chen, Farnoosh Hashemi, **Shubham Mohole**, Ethan Gearey, Michael Macy, Saeed Hassanpour, Soroush Vosoughi

*North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2025)*

[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.203.pdf)

*This paper presents a multi-LLM communication framework with 6 specialized agents to automatically generate high-quality persuasive dialogues with minimal human oversight. Human annotators could distinguish LLM-generated utterances from human-written ones only 29.25% of the time (near-random), with dialogue quality scores averaging 2.97/3 for coherence and 3/3 for clarity.*
