## Conference Papers

**VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2025*  
[Paper]({{ '/assets/VeriMinder_Paper.pdf' | relative_url }}) | [Website](https://veriminder.ai)

*VeriMinder addresses cognitive biases in natural language database queries through a three-stage framework: contextual semantic mapping, Hard-to-Vary principle operationalization, and optimized LLM-powered refinement. User evaluation shows 82.5% positive impact on analysis quality with significant improvements in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.*

**SIFOTL: A Principled, Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular Learning**  
**Shubham Mohole**, Sainyam Galhotra  
*ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2025*  
[Paper]({{ '/assets/SIFOTL_Paper.pdf' | relative_url }})

*SIFOTL identifies factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets using privacy-compliant statistical summaries, twin XGBoost models, and Pareto-weighted decision trees. Achieves F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 on synthetic EHR datasets while maintaining privacy compliance.*
