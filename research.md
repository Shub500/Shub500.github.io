# Research

My research focuses on developing robust, interpretable machine learning systems that can operate reliably in real-world environments. I am particularly interested in the intersection of privacy-preserving ML, natural language interfaces, and AI safety.

## Research Areas

### Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
I work on developing machine learning systems that can learn from distributed data while preserving privacy and maintaining operational independence. My work on SAVL-II demonstrates how agents can collaborate in federated learning settings without runtime dependencies.

### Natural Language Interfaces to Databases
Through VeriMinder, I explore how to make NL2SQL systems more robust by addressing cognitive biases and analytical vulnerabilities in user queries. This work bridges human-computer interaction and database systems.

### Robust Tabular Learning
SIFOTL addresses the challenge of identifying true signal from noise in tabular datasets, particularly important in healthcare applications where data quality and privacy constraints are paramount.

### AI Safety and Interpretability
I'm interested in developing AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable and safe. My work often focuses on providing explainable outputs and maintaining human oversight in automated systems.

## Current Projects

### VeriMinder: Analytical Vulnerability Detection
*Advisor: Prof. Sainyam Galhotra*

Developing an interactive system that identifies and mitigates cognitive biases in natural language database queries. The system uses contextual semantic mapping and operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle to guide users toward robust analytical questions.

### SIFOTL: Privacy-Safe Data Shift Detection
*Advisor: Prof. Sainyam Galhotra*

Creating a framework for identifying factors driving data shifts in healthcare datasets while operating only on privacy-safe statistical summaries. The system uses twin XGBoost models and Pareto-weighted decision trees.

### VeriMed-RAG: Biomedical Validation
*Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory*

Developing a retrieval-augmented generation framework for validating biomedical propositions through systematic methodological quality assessment.
